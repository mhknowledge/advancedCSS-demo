## Description

This demo was designed to lay the ground work of what will ultimately become my personal portfolio.  As we progress upon the path of becoming full stack developer, so too will this page progress and improve to where it will acurately showcase my skills and talents.

Thus far, the page displays the implementation of matters that we've covered up this point regarding HTML, basic & advanced CSS.
